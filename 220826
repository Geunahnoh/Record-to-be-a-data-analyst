what I learned:

1
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country and CustomerName;

이렇게 2개로 했을때 결과가 다르게 나온다... 헐?

Did you notice that we did not insert any number into the CustomerID field?
The CustomerID column is an auto-increment field and will be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into the table.

customer id를 굳이 추가하지 않아도 된는 것 알게 됨

Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. 
A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!

Always use IS NULL to look for NULL values.

Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. 
The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. 
If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!
