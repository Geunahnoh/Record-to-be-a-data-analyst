what I leanred:

1
select top / limit / fetch -> they are all different!!! wow how confusing haha


2
when you wanna see TOP 3 OR top 50 percent ->
select top 3 * from customers;
*don't forget to put '*'


3
like wildcard...
The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
 The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character
(from w3 school) 
 so it means underscore sign doesn't represent zero...?
 
 
 4
 not like <-> like
ex.
select * from Customers
where ContactName not like 'a%';


5
Wildcard characters are used with the LIKE operator. 
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
(from w3 school)



6
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "b", "s", or "p": (from w3 school)
select * from Customers
where City like '[bsp]%'; 

difficult...!


7
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "a", "b", or "c": (from w3)
select * from Customers
where City like '[a-c]%'; 

I can say [abc]% but abc is a serial ? consistent? so I can just say a-c
I guess...



8
when I wanna use !...
select * from Customers
where City like '[!bsp]%'; 

or

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT LIKE '[bsp]%';

-> please put ! in the []... got it?
-> i can use 'not like' instead of using '!'


9
The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
(from w3) -> or can be used instead of 'in'




10
select * from customers
where country in (select country from suppliers);

next to 'in' I can put another select phrase... oh interesting-!


11
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Mozzarella di Giovanni'
ORDER BY ProductName;

yay, using 'between and' for text 
i could make the query-!



12
in 'between' date option-
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN #07/01/1996# AND #07/31/1996#;

or

SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31';

-> we need '#' and 'always date needs 00 so if the date is 1st July, I need to put 0701
-> year-month-day or month-day-year order
